                <p>Getting a final image without all the intermediate build layers</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h1>Why?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep things only needed for building out of the final image</li>
                    <li>Separation of concerns</li>
                    <li>Optimize build</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Keeping things out of the final image has two advantages. 1: The less that is there the less
                        tools an attacker has to work with. 2: Making the final running image smaller can save some
                        resources</p>
                    <p>Build can also be faster because if there are multiple stages buildkit may run them in parallel
                        if resources and dependencies between the projects permit</p>

                <h1>How?</h1>

                    FROM sdk AS builder
                    COPY source .

                    FROM gen AS datagenerator
                    COPY data-source .
                    RUN generate.sh

                    FROM runtime
                    COPY --from=builder build-result/mycmd .

                </code></pre>
                <aside class="notes">
                    Here the builder and the datagenerator don't depend on each other so they could end up being run in
                    parallell. The final image depends on both of them so will be build last.

                    You don have to start from a base image. If you start from the special keyword `scratch` you will

                    the files you add to it, no operating system or anything. That's only useful if you don't need them
                    but can give really

                    <li>You want your images to be as slim as

                        contains.

                    <li>This usually means multi-stage builds and carefully picking the base for your runtime

                <p>Example: Run <code>docker debug --shell bash my-app</code> inside you can now run the usual tools,
